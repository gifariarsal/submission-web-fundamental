          <p>
            Drow Ranger's given name is Traxex--a name well suited to the short,
            trollish, rather repulsive Drow people. But Traxex herself is not a
            Drow. Her parents were travelers in a caravan set upon by bandits,
            whose noisy slaughter of innocents roused the ire of the quiet Drow
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the battle settled, the Drow discovered a small girl-child
            hiding in the ruined wagons, and agreed she could not be abandoned.
            Even as child, Traxex showed herself naturally adept at the arts
            they prized: Stealth, silence, subtlety. In spirit, if not in
            physique, she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her
            proper home. But as she grew, she towered above her family and came
            to think of herself as ugly. After all, her features were smooth and
            symmetrical, entirely devoid of warts and coarse whiskers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the
            woods. Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes
            speak of an impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep
            among the trees, then vanished like a dream before they could
            approach. Lithe and stealthy, icy hot, she moves like mist in
            silence. That whispering you hear is her frozen arrows finding an
            enemy's heart.

                <p>
                  Drow's experiences in battle grant her a chance to launch arrows with incredible accuracy and effectiveness. Pierces through the enemy's defenses, ignoring their base armor. Grants Drow and nearby ranged heroes with bonus agility based on Drow's current agility, with allies receiving 50% of the bonus Drow receives. This ability is disabled if there is an enemy hero within 400 range.
